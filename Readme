neo4j_fdw

The view that neo4j_fdw assumes graph database neo4j a source of information
contribute it via the interface of the foreign table wrapper of PostgreSQL.
In addition, I hand URL and Cypher query with an argument and offer a function to receive a result in JSON.

In CREATE SERVER, I set a connection URL to Neo4j.
Set Cypher query offering in column and Neo4j which I want to return in CREATE FOREIGN TABLE.
It is necessary to match the RETURN phrase of the Cypher query with the column which I want to return.

How to use please refer to a test folder.
(after loading data.xml in the data folder.)
